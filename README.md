# Pokemon
This data exploration and analysis was conducted on an Excel database of Pok√©mon, consisting of four sheets: Pokemon, Moves, Evolution, and TypeChart. The column names of the two sheets used in this project are outlined below.

Pokemon: #, Name, Type, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense

Evolution: Evolving from, Evolving to, Level, Condition, Evolution Type

The data exploration and visualisation was conducted in Python 3, with the following software packpages: Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and SciKit Learn.
The attribute data was normalised to allow for direct comparison between each of the attributes. Linear normalisation was used (Max-Min, and standardising to 100).

A summary of the project can be viewed as a PDF, or the code and its output can be viewed as a Jupyter notebook. Both are in the repository.
